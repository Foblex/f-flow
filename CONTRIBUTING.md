### Contributing to Foblex Flow

Hello there! We’re thrilled that you’re interested in contributing to Foblex Flow 😃. Your support is invaluable to us. Here’s a guide on how you can get involved with the project.

### Our Contributing Philosophy

The direction of Foblex Flow, including which new features are added and which are left out, is decided by the core team. Although we don’t offer financial compensation, we deeply value the contributions from the community. Your efforts in fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving the library are highly appreciated.

Foblex Flow thrives because of the community that uses, shares, and discusses it. Non-code contributions are some of the most valuable and often overlooked aspects of open source, and we especially welcome help in these areas.

### How can I help?

We need help with the following:

 - 🔍 **Bug Reports**: We can’t catch all bugs ourselves. Check existing
   issues and discussions first, then create a new issue to report any
   bugs you find. 
 - 💬 **Answering Questions**: Help answer questions in
   our  GitHub discussions. 
 - 📹 **Creating Tutorials**: Share your
   tutorials with us and we’ll happily promote them!

All interactions should be conducted with respect and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for enhancing Foblex Flow, please use the New Features discussion section. If you plan to implement it yourself, reach out to us before starting a pull request. The direction of Foblex Flow and feature additions are discussed in our GitHub discussions, but ultimately decided by the core team.

Discussing your enhancement idea with us first increases the chances of your pull request being accepted. We don’t want you to spend time on something we might already be working on or that might not fit with the library’s core.

### Contact Us

For questions about potential enhancements, email us at support@foblex.com.

### Pull Requests

If you want to contribute improvements or new features, we are happy to review your PR. Please ensure you follow our code style guidelines and provide meaningful commit messages along with a brief description of your changes.

Thank you for contributing to Foblex Flow!
