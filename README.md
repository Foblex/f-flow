## Welcome to Foblex Flow

Foblex Flow is an [Angular](https://angular.dev/) library built to simplify the creation and management of dynamic, interactive flows. 
Whether you're developing complex systems or lightweight visualizations, Foblex Flow provides a robust set of tools to help automate node manipulation and inter-node connections with ease. It's fully compatible with Angular 12+, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and the Composition API.

### Examples

Explore practical use cases to see Foblex Flow in action:

- [Call Center](https://github.com/Foblex/f-flow-example) - A streamlined flow example simulating a call flow.

- [Scheme Editor](https://github.com/Foblex/f-scheme-editor) - A more advanced example of a fully interactive scheme editor.

- [Visual Programming](https://flow.foblex.com/examples/f-visual-programming-flow/) - An example of a visual programming flow.

- [DB Management](https://flow.foblex.com/examples/f-db-management-flow/) - An example of a database management flow.

### Features

1. **Node and Connection Creation:** Dynamically generate and manipulate nodes and their connections.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Built-in events for nodes and connections to allow seamless interaction handling.
3. **Reassign Connections:** Easily reassign connections between nodes, allowing for flexible flow adjustments.
4. **Custom Templates:** Fully customizable node and connection templates for tailored visual representation.
5. **Drag-and-Drop:** Simplified drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive flow manipulation.
6. **Zoom and Pan Support:** Explore large flows with smooth zooming and panning controls.

### Roadmap

We have a detailed roadmap for the development of Foblex Flow. Check out the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) to see the upcoming features and milestones.

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you can use Foblex Flow to create draggable nodes and connections:

```html

<f-flow fDraggable>
  <f-canvas>
    <f-connection fOutputId="output1" fInputId="input1"></f-connection>
    <div fNode fDragHandle [fNodePosition]="{ x: 24, y: 24 }" fNodeOutput fOutputId="output1" fOutputConnectableSide="right"> Drag me</div>
    <div fNode fDragHandle [fNodePosition]="{ x: 244, y: 24 }" fNodeInput fInputId="input1" fInputConnectableSide="left"> Drag me</div>
  </f-canvas>
</f-flow>
```
