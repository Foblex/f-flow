# Roadmap

## Introduction  
Foblex Flow is an Angular library designed to simplify the creation and manipulation of dynamic flows.  
This roadmap outlines the key milestones and objectives for the project's development.

## Key Milestones

### Planned Tasks

### In Progress
- **Create connections without defining node inputs and outputs** *(In Progress)*  
  Removes the strict input/output designation for nodes, allowing connections to be created and attached in any direction.

- **Customize triggers for drag and zoom events** *(In Progress)*  
  Enables users to define their own key combinations for triggering events like drag, zoom, and other interactions.
