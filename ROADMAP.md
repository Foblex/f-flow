# 🛣 Foblex Flow Roadmap

Welcome to the official development roadmap for **Foblex Flow** - an Angular-native library for building customizable visual flow editors, workflow builders, and diagram systems.

This file now tracks two things in one place:

- what is currently queued, in progress, or planned,
- what has already shipped, based on published GitHub releases.

This roadmap is synchronized with the release history through **v18.3.0 (2026-03-17)**.

| ✅ **Released in v18.3.0** | **Projected Connection Gradients** | Gradient colors now live in projected `f-connection-gradient`. The release also shipped redraw caching, production-safe worker loading, and the related docs refresh. |
| 🚧 **In Progress**         | **Freeform Connections**           | Create connections without explicitly defined inputs/outputs. Connect from/to any node edge. [↗](https://github.com/Foblex/f-flow/discussions/88)                    |
| 🧭 **Planned**             | **Grid-Aware Resize Handles**      | Resize handles will snap to gridlines to ensure precise alignment. [↗](https://github.com/Foblex/f-flow/discussions/130)                                             |
