## [17.6.0](https://github.com/foblex/flow/compare/v17.5.5...v17.6.0) (2025-07-23)

### Features

- **Improved Connection Reassignment**
  - Enhanced the logic and UX for reassigning connections, allowing both source and target to be dynamically changed.
  - Updated class names for clarity and improved drag handle behavior and styling.  
    ([7aef9f3](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/7aef9f3eacc134d1e1c81f66516f4238ae98855d), [bbb6d56](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/bbb6d56d35c2b95f8d07f414910a45bd15126a8a), [d8de100](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/d8de100cbebfe1c540ad927e0c20b654fedcc0f7))

- **Signal-based Refactors for Reactivity**
  - Refactored the following to use Angular Signals for more efficient change detection and reactivity:
    - `fConnectionCenter`  
      ([421b0ef](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/421b0efae24a19c117fd314cbb9cec144384f681), [439760c](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/439760c5c1302e16dba7fc0790530225a9e99c63))
    - `fDefs`, `fTextComponent`  
      ([06e9457](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/06e94574d154f695174083e2f8d39b4141b20b9d))
    - `fId` across multiple interfaces and components  
      ([3034d5d](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/3034d5d19997020745d870bba61be82a0933a914))
    - `fPath` logic  
      ([a1b1314](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/a1b131446bc2cb486fcf940458105af1200ae768))
    - `fSelection` initialization and management  
      ([31b6af1](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/31b6af1bf68623a0942f5084ad7c41b70f34347e))

- **Minimap Improvements**
  - Restructured the minimap component.
  - Enhanced input handling and upgraded it to support new Angular features.  
    ([c7a3be9](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/c7a3be936eecaaa10b4da49c3b77a4ff496dae75))

- **Debounced `fCanvasChange` Event**
  - Added optional debounce to the `fCanvasChange` event in `FCanvasComponent` to reduce event noise during rapid updates.
  - Configurable via debounceTime input
  
- **New `fDragBlocker` Directive**
  - Introduced fDragBlocker directive to block drag-and-drop interactions within specific areas of the canvas.
  - Useful for excluding certain zones (like panels or overlays) from initiating node movement or connection creation.

### üêû Bug Fixes

- **Drag-and-Drop on macOS**
  - Fixed issues with drag-and-drop interactions on macOS by improving event handling.  
    ([#187](https://github.com/foblex/flow/issues/187), [142745c](https://github.com/foblex/flow/commit/142745c277736b0c43085dde5c6590eb90ca87f1))

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- **Updated `FReassignConnectionEvent` structure**
  - The event model was redesigned to support both source and target reassignment with more detailed context.

  **Before:**
  ```ts
  new FReassignConnectionEvent(
    fConnectionId: string,
    fOutputId: string,
    oldFInputId: string,
    newFInputId: string | undefined,
    fDropPosition: IPoint
  )
  ```
  **After:**
  ```ts
  new FReassignConnectionEvent(
    connectionId: string,
    isSourceReassign: boolean,
    isTargetReassign: boolean,
    oldSourceId: string,
    newSourceId: string | undefined,
    oldTargetId: string,
    newTargetId: string | undefined,
    dropPoint: IPoint
  )
  ```
  This change improves the accuracy of reassignment tracking and enables more flexible behavior in advanced flow editors.
