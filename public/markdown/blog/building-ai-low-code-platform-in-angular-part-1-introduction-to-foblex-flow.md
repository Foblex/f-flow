# Building AI Low-Code Platform in Angular— Part 1: Introduction to Foblex Flow

Introduction to the series and the Foblex Flow library — a flexible tool for creating flow-based UIs in Angular. Learn the core concepts behind low-code architecture.

## ✍ Introduction

Modern web applications increasingly require visual logic and process editors — from call flow builders to no-code tools or internal dashboards.

If you work with Angular, you know how difficult it is to find a truly native solution for creating such flow interfaces.

That’s why I created Foblex Flow — a library designed specifically for Angular to build flexible and dynamic node-based UIs.

## 🔧 What is Foblex Flow?

Foblex Flow is an Angular library for building interactive node-and-connection-based interfaces — fully written in Angular.

With it, you can:

- Render and connect nodes dynamically

- Customize node templates freely

- Use drag’n’drop, zooming, snapping, and grouping

- Integrate with SSR, standalone components, Angular Signals, and zoneless Angular

- Build complete editors with state saving and custom logic

## 🧩 Where You Might Use It

- Workflow editors

- Logic configurators (low-code / no-code)

- Call routing editors

- Visual back-office or CRM tools

- Visual programming UIs (block logic, AI chains)

## 🔍 What You’ll Learn in This Series

In this series of tutorials, we’ll cover:

1. How to install and render a basic flow

2. How to use custom components as nodes

3. How to configure and customize connections

4. How to enable snapping, resize, and rotate

5. How to save and restore flow state

6. How to build a real-world editor with the library

## 📚 Live Examples

Here are a few interactive examples built with Foblex Flow:

- 📞 Call Flow Editor

- 🧱 Logic Configuration Tool

- 🗄 Database Flow Manager

## 🚀 Features

- 🔌 Dynamic node and connection management

- 🧠 Event-driven architecture for nodes and links

- ✏️ Full customization of templates and visuals

- 🔍 Zooming, panning, snapping, and guide support

- 🧱 Grouping and alignment with grid snapping

- 📦 Compatible with SSR, standalone components, Angular Signals, and zoneless Angular
